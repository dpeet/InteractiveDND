SIFT and SURF are missing in opencv 3 as per http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/07/16/where-did-sift-and-surf-go-in-opencv-3/

May need to `export DISPLAY=":0" `
before starting program

need to edit config.ini (sudo nano ~/.kivy/config.ini)  from https://github.com/mrichardson23/rpi-kivy-screen

Go into the [input] section, remove the lines that are in there and put in:

mouse = mouse
mtdev_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=mtdev
hid_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=hidinput
